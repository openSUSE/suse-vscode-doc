## Features

The DocBook Snippets extension includes templates of both simple and complex DocBook structures.
You can populate the templates by pressing the initial DocBook markup letters. For example,
pressing `li` results in `<listitem>insert content</listitem>`. The list of templates is not complete and will be extended with future releases.
