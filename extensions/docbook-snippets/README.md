# docbook-snippets README

## Features

The DocBook Snippets extension includes templates of both simple and complex
DocBook structures. You can populate the templates by pressing the initial
DocBook markup letters. For example, pressing `li` results in `<listitem>insert
content</listitem>`. The list of snippets is not complete and is being extended
as required.
