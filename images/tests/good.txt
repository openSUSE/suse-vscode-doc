Configuring the singularity drive

You can configure the Quantum Computer (QC) for faster-than-light travel. Follow these steps.

Accessing the configuration panel

1. Boot the QC BIOS.
2. Navigate to "Advanced Settings".
3. Select "Singularity Drive Management" (SDM).

Optimizing for temporal displacement

Configure the SDM parameters as follows.

Flux capacitor calibration

Set to 1.21 jigowatts.

Temporal coordinates

Enter the desired date. For example, enter 01/01/3000.

Activating the chroniton accelerator

Click "Engage". This initiates temporal displacement.

Troubleshooting

Temporal displacement can be tricky. The QC user manual has more details. Refer to the temporal displacement appendix.

Common issues

1. Time paradoxes.
2. Chroniton leaks.
3. Missing destination. Check the coordinates. The Earth might not exist at the destination date.

If these tips do not help, contact QC support. They are available 24/7.
